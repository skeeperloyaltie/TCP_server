1. All code contributions to the TCP Server and Client project must be reviewed by a member of the project's development team before being merged.

2. Any discovered vulnerabilities should be reported immediately to the development team through the appropriate channels (e.g. GitHub issue tracker, email).

3. All sensitive data, such as passwords and private keys, should be encrypted and stored in a secure location.

4. Passwords and private keys must never be included in code commits or pushed to the GitHub repository.

5. All third-party libraries and dependencies used in the project must be regularly updated to ensure they are free from known vulnerabilities.

6. Code reviews must include a review of the security of the code and any potential vulnerabilities.

7. Regular security audits must be conducted on the project to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

8. The development team must be trained in secure coding practices and be familiar with the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

9. Any security breaches or suspected security breaches must be reported immediately to the development team and appropriate authorities.

10. Regular backups of the GitHub repository must be conducted to ensure that any lost or compromised code can be restored.

By following these guidelines, we aim to ensure the highest level of security for our TCP Server and Client project and protect the sensitive data of our users.
